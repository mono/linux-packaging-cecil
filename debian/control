Description: library to generate and inspect CIL assemblies
 Cecil is a library under development to generate and inspect programs and
 libraries in the ECMA CIL format.
 .
 In simple English, with Cecil, you can load existing managed assemblies,
 browse all the contained types, modify them on the fly and save back to the
 disk the modified assembly.
 .
 Today it is used by the Mono Debugger by the bug-finding and compliance
 checking tool Gendarme as well as DB4O.
