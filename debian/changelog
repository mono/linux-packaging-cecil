cecil (0.6+svn148654-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Move to git and update Vcs-* metadata 
  * New upstream SVN snapshot, needed for db4o
  * Package as unstable as the library is not considered by upstream to be API
    or ABI stable. Consumers must now copy the library.
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/patches: Disable patchsys as this was
    only used to change assembly version which is now not necessary.
  * debian/rules, debian/mono.snk.uue: No need to sign now, not necessary for
    unstable libs.
  * debian/control, debian/libmono-cecil-cil-dev*: Drop -dev package as this
    is used for dynamic linking, which we are not doing any more.
  * debian/changelog, debian/clean, debian/libmono-cecil-cil.docs: Update
    dh7isation
  * debian/control: Change build-depends on packages provided by `mono' source
    package to mono-devel (>= 2.4.3) as this provides all we need.
